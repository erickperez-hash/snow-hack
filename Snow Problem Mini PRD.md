## **Problem Statement**

Property and vehicle owners experience unexpected obstructions, liability exposure, and potential municipal fines because of sporadic and unpredictable snowfall, resulting in substantial costs, time pressure, and difficulty securing reliable snow removal services on short notice.

---

## **Value Proposition**

SnowProblem is a bidding platform for property and vehicle owners who need timely, reliable snow removal services, connecting them with local service providers (from individuals with shovels to professionals with plows) through a transparent bidding system that ensures competitive pricing, proof of work, and scheduling flexibility.

## **Users and Needs**

### **Primary Users:**

**1\. Property Owners**

* **Key need:** As a property owner, I need to clear my property within mandated timeframes after snowfall because I face liability risks, municipal fines, and responsibility for safe access to my property.

**2\. Vehicle Owners**

* **Key need:** As a vehicle owner, I need my driveway/parking space cleared before my commute time because I must get to work or appointments on schedule and cannot risk being blocked in by snow.

**3\. Service Providers** (individuals with snow removal equipment)

* **Key need:** As a service provider with snow removal equipment, I need to find paying jobs during snow events because I have excess capacity and want to generate income from my available time and equipment.

---

## **Proposed Solution**

SnowProblem is a mobile and web platform that connects property and vehicle owners with local snow removal service providers through a competitive bidding system. Property owners post snow removal jobs with photos, location, and desired completion time; nearby service providers submit bids with estimated pricing and timeframes. Owners select the best bid, and providers complete the work and submit proof-of-completion photos. The platform handles scheduling, payment processing, and verification to ensure quality and accountability.
